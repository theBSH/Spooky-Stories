It was night time. A {gender} was starring at a monitor. It was quiet and peaceful, at least it is before the war starts. Also in {possession} mind there was no peace to be found, mental health problems were stalking {pronoun} 24/7. But anyways here {pronoun2} was starring at the {obj} on {possession} desk. So many thing could be done with it, So many places it could go! But {pronoun2} was to tired for that, After all {pronoun2} was a {des} person. So many good things to see but to much dark to ignore. Hopefully {pronoun2} can recover. We should just wait and see ... Like we always do.
